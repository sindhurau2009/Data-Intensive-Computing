Activities:

1. Part1.ipynb: Tutorial on dplyr, an R package that supports SQL functions on R dataframes such as groupby, summarise, mutate.

2. Activity1.ipynb: The XML file present at http://aiweb.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/xmltk/xmldata/data/courses/reed.xml is converted to csv file using ldply package in R.

3. Activity2_1.ipynb: European soccer data is obtained from Kaggle (database.sqlite). The task here is to separate all the tables, select the ones that are required for us and perform joins on them so as to gete only the required columns from each table to 2 dataframes, namely 'Players' and 'Teams'. This data is stored in "Players.csv" and "Teams.csv" files. Queries such as "Top 10 players by number of appearances" and such needs to be answered, hence these dataframes are filtered so as to obtain the data in a sorted and consistent manner.

4. Activity2_2.ipynb: The csv files obtained from above activity are loaded into 2 dataframes and queries described in the end are answered.

5. Activity3.ipynb: Data about Gaming, Jobs and Broadband from Pew Research Center is collected and stored in File1.csv. This data is manually analyzed, queries have been drawn on intuition and they are answered using various plots in ggplot2. Each query and the description of plots are given in the activity.
