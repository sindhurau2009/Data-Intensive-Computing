Activities:

1. Example1 is a Tableau tutorial on WorldBankData so as to understand the Tableau interface and how the representation of relation of various parts of the data changes according to the way we filter them. There are many visualization models in Tableau and I have implemented some along with dashboard and story in here.

2. Example2 is another data analytics visualization task in Tableau that analyzes the correlation of attributes such as season, weather, temperature, humidity, working day and displays the count of the bike sharing users in each area for a particular time period. This analysis will be helpful to predict the number of casual and registered bike sharing users in future based on the same attributes in various places. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle.

3. Data-Product-Implementation: I have developed UI using RShiny (in app.R) and implemented "randomForest" classification algorithm to predict the count of bike sharing users for the test data and show the variation of training and testing regression plots.
  The product is published and is open to viewers at: https://sindhurauppu.shinyapps.io/bikesharing/
