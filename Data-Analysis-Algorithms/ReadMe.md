# This project aims to implement data analysis algorithms such as Linear Regression, k-means and knn clustering algorithm.

# RGraphics.ipynb analyzes landdata-states.csv and uses ggplot2 to visualize Linear Model trained on the data. This is a sample LM and ggplot2 tutorial to get to know the commands.

# k-means-vignette.ipynb is a tutorial on k-mean clustering using Iris dataset. This dataset is present in R by default.

# k-means clustering.ipynb is a worked out example on customer data obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository which uses k-means clustering and handles the outliers and output clusters.

# Activity1_LM.ipynb is a linear model task that trains NHL Top 100 players data using a linear model (lm) and visualizes the model using slope and intercept obtained from the model. 
  The desciption of various plots in the iPython notebook are given below each plot for understanding.
  
# Activity2_knn.ipynb is a knn task that shows the variation of mis-classification rate for different set of k values on german credit data.

# Activity3_k-means.ipynb is a k-means implementation that plots a graph for each set of clusters on various columns taken from the dataset about social issues from Pew Research Center.
