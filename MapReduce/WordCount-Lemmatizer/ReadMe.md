1. The goal of this task is to lemmatize word present in the classical text files, 'lucan.bellum_civile.part.1.tess' and 'vergil.aeneid.tess'.
2. A lemmatization file is given so as to convert the words based on this file.
3. These files are taken as input while running the program 'Lemma.java' on commandline in HDFD and the resulting output of wordcount after converting words to their lemmas is stored in lemma/part-r-00000 file.
4. 20 other such latin text files are taken and the same program has been run on these files and the resulting output for all these documents is stored in lemma20/part-r-00000 file.
