1. Scalability of word co-occurrence algorithms implemented in activity 2 is improved here.
2. Using stripes, time taken to find the word co-occurrence of input files, which are being incremented by 5 files each time, is noted and is plotted in 2neighbors.jpeg.
3. The output for 2 neighbors co-occurrance is present in Stripes16/part-r-00000 file.
4. For finding word co-occurrence of 3 neighbors, the stripes algorithms is modified a bit (Stripes1.java) and the resulting time for each iteration is plotted in 3neighbors.jpeg.
5. The output for word co-occurrence of 3 neighbors is present in act4op/part-r-00000 file.
